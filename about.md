# About

Hi, I'm Cameron!

I'm passionate about Computer Vision, Robotics, Deep Learning, Bayesian Analysis and Flight.

I'm writing a blog because the first step to better understanding something is to try and explain it to someone else. 

I currently work with Airbus in Toulouse, France, where I get to learn from some incredible people, while helping to shape the future of the Aerospace industry.

Before then, I worked for QANTAS Airways in Australia, with a focus on AI & Emerging Technologies.
