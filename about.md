### About Me
Currently I'm completing my thesis in Electrical Engineering at the University of New South Wales.
I'm passionate about Electrical Engineering, Finance & Computer Science.
I aim to make complex topics or ideas acessible to an audiance that is interest but have a formal background in the area.
I belive that being able to clearly explain a topic is a key step in understanding it.
