I've had this on and off flirtation with Bayesian analysis. It's an interesting area, philosophically compelling, and some new and exciting tools are coming out.

I want to share my adventures solving with TFP with you, but first of all, I want to tell a story that explains my interest and passion in bayesian analysis.

I'm going to go back a few years, to when I was working on the launch of inflight WiFi at Qantas. For context, Qantas is an Australian airline, which has a proud history of technical innovations, including the world's longest flight (33 hours), and the escape slide raft. It's also an airline with a strong brand, where customers have an expectation of quality. 

The WiFi system we launching was Fast, and Free. Customers would get a reliable internet connection, that would be objectively (in 2017) the fastest in the world. It would also be free for all, included in the ticket price. Customers pay a premium for Qantas, because they have every expectation they have justifiably high expectations.

To provide the bandwidth, each of our fleet of ±80 aircraft would connect to a pair of satellites, via more than 100 different spot beams, illuminating different parts of continental Australia. 

Obviously all of this was easier said than done, and as the date of the launch approached, questions arose regarding the stability of the system, and if it was ready for launch. One way we can get more confidence is to put an engineer on a flight to run tests and collect data, at a cost of say $100 an hour. Or we can charter the aircraft, and subject it to a higher level of testing, at a cost of say $10,000 an hour. In reality however, there is a limit to how much testing we can do before the launch date. If we don't have enough confidence in the performance of the system, we need to push the launch date, which has some large, but unquantifiable cost. 

This is where bayesian analysis really came into its own. Ultimately we need to know how much data we need to collect, to have a certain level of confidence. When you are asked by senior management if the system will work come game day, there is a huge difference between saying "There is a 98% chance it will work, but I'm not really that confident in that number." and "There is a 98% chance it will work, and we have all the date we need to be confident."

At the end of the day, the system worked admirably, but it was the power of bayesian analysis that made sure that I had the right level of confidence.
