A contradiction
===============
*The following example is purely hypothetical*

Lets say you are an airline executive, and you notice there are a lot of tweets from passengers complaigning that there were cramped, and there wasn't enough space in the overhead bins for their bag because their flight was so full. Many of the tweets point out that the majority of the time they fly, there are fewer than 10 seats avalible on the plane. 

To get to the bottom of the issue, you decide to go and look at how common it is for an aircraft to fly while it is nearly full. To your supprise, you find that it's quite rare for the plane to have less than 10 seats avalilble, in fact it only happens 20% of the time.


You are left with a contradiction, on the one hand, passengers are claiming that their flight was almost full more than 50% of the time, but you know that this only happens 20% of the time. You consider discounting the passengers, given that you have hard, empirical data which contradicts them. However, on reflection you realize that both you, and the passengers are right. This contradiction is everywhere you look, and it's called the *Observation Bias*.

A Solution
===============

Both the passengers and the executive are looking at the same sitation from different points of view. The passengers are basing their conclusion on their *personal* point of view, the executive is looking at the problem from a *per aircraft* point of view. Put simply, if you are a passenger, you are more likely to be on a full plane, than an empty one.

Taking an extreme example, let's say your airline flys Boeing 717's with 125 seats. 


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/14/LOPA.jpg)


If 90% of your flights fly empty, and 10% of your flights fly at 100% capacity, then over 10 flights, you have flown 125 people. From the executive's perspective, only 10% of flights are crowded, but from the passengers perspective, 100% of flights are crowded. 

The more you look, the more often you will find this kind of bias.
Lets say that a train arrives at a station, *on average* every 5 minutes.
The *average* wait for a passenger isn't 5 minutes, if there is any variance in the time between trains. At first blush, this statement appears to be simply wrong, however, consider the following. The longer the gap between two trains, the more likely you are to arrive at the station and start waiting. Consider the following example, where trains arrive at a station twice an hour, at 5 past the hour, and 10 past the hour. If you randomly arrive at the station, you are 11 times more likely to catch the train that leaves at 5 past, than the 10 past train.
