Summary
===============

I have about 3 weeks to study for an exam titled "Advanced Digital Signal Processing", I also have a shiny new Software Defined Radio (SDR) called and Airspy. My goal for the next 3 weeks is to write a post a day, where I try and put what I've learned into practice.

What is an SDR?
===============

It's an box that takes in an RF signal at one end, and uses <del>black magic</del>  RF electronics to digitize a section of the spectrum. You can then go away and process this digital signal to your hearts content. The fastest and cheapest way to get started is [$20 RTL-SDR dongle](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/). A comparison of a number of SDR's on the market can be found [here](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/roundup-software-defined-radios/).

The Airspy
===============

The Airspy is a [$200USD](http://imall.iteadstudio.com/im141027001.html) software designed radio, and while it doesn't beat the bang for buck of an RTL-SDR, It's a fantastic buy. Initially, I borrowed a RTL-SDR dongle and an antenna from a friend, and a week later made the decision to go for the Airspy. 


By way of comparison:

* The Airspy can detect effectively the same range of frequencies as a RTL-SDR (24Mhz-1800Mhz), 
* The Airspy has an 12 Bit ADC, the RTL-SDR has a 7 bit ADC.
* The Airspy can acquire 10M samples a second, an RTL-SDR at about 2.5M samples a second.

You can find out more information about the different RTL-SDR models [here](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)

Just what can you do with an SDR?

* Listen to the radio
* Track planes in [flight](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/adsb-aircraft-radar-with-rtl-sdr/)
* Listen to [Air Traffic Control](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?aid=1117)
* Download live images of the earth from space, off a [Russian weather satellite](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-receiving-meteor-m-n2-lrpt-weather-satellite-images-rtl-sdr/)

[Here](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/) is a more comprehensive list!

Ultimately, you can pick up anything in the [VHF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency) band, and a good portion of the [UHF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency) band. Using a SDR is the fastest way to open your eyes to what is happening in the RF spectrum all around you, all the time.
