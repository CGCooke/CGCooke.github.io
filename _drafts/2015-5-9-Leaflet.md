Summary
===============

---

Contour plots
===============

{% highlight python %}
{% endhighlight %}

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/8/ContourMapTight.png)

GeoTIFFs
===============


Finally, we are left with a TIFF file called "OUT.TIFF" which we can open in Google Earth. Simply go to File -> Import, and open the GeoTIFF.
