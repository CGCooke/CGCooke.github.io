>  How far we can see is only limited by the horion, which raises the question, how do we see further?

The Horizon
===============

The distance to the horizon is a simple matter of geometry, the straight line distance to the horizon (d) is a function of your height above the horizon (h), and the radius of the earth (R). 

$$ d = \sqrt{h \times (2\times R + h)}$$

This results in a distance along the surface of the earth (s) of : 

$$ s =  R \times tan^{-1} \frac{d}{R}$$

Limitations
===============

The horizon ultimately limits what we can see, and while this sounds rather metaphysical, it has practical real world consequences. 

Radar is typically limited to line of sight, with some notable [exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jindalee_Operational_Radar_Network). This results in what is called a [Radar Horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_horizon).  Ships, aircraft and missiles below the horizon are essnetially invisible to the radar. This has the practical consequence that a

Talk about flying radar

The logical solution to this problem, is to increase the height of the radar above the earths surface.
