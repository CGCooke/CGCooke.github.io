>  How far we can see is only limited by the horion, which raises the question, how do we see further?

The Horizon
===============

The distance to the horizon is a simple matter of geometry, the straight line distance to the horizon (d) is a function of your height above the horizon (h), and the radius of the earth (R). 

$$ d = \sqrt{h \times (2\times R + h)}$$

This results in a distance along the surface of the earth (s) of : 

$$ s =  R \times tan^{-1} \frac{d}{R}$$
