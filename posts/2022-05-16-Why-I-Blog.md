Why do I blog?

It's a question I've been debating with myself. It's easy to argue that writing a blog is an investment, but is it a good one?

When I'm doing a post, it's about something I'm learning or something interesting. Writing a blog helps me crystalize what is in my mind, and often explaining something allows me to see new connections and perspectives. I think you truly understand a concept once you can concisely explain it to someone else.

It's also challenging, and I love solving gnarly challenges. 

It's also a great way to share with the community. While I love exciting new papers, the symbiotic blog posts accompanying them are where the real value lies. 

I'm blogging for a future self, as much as anyone else. A blog post is an elegant way to encapsulate, in a concrete form, lessons that have been learned at the cost of much time, sweat and treasure.

While I love writing, it's a big-time commitment, and I last invested the time a year ago. However, I want to get back to writing because, like any skill, it takes practice. The following year will allow me to bring you many new posts.

This is why I blog.
