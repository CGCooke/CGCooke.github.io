Hi, I'm Cameron.

I'm passionate about Computer Vision, Graphics, Robotics, Deep Learning, Bayesian Analysis, Electronics, and Flight.

I'm writing a blog because the first step to better understanding something is to try and explain it to someone else. 

I currently work with Airbus in Toulouse, France as a Computer Vision Specialist.

Before then, I worked for QANTAS Airways in Australia, with a focus on AI & Emerging Technologies.

You can read more about what I do with Airbus [here](https://www.airbus.com/careers/working-for-airbus/faces-of-airbus/meet-cameron.html).

I also write a technical [blog](https://cgcooke.github.io/Blog/).
