Hi, I'm Cameron!

I'm passionate about Computer Vision, Graphics, Robotics, Deep Learning, Bayesian Analysis, Electronics, and Flight.

I'm writing a blog because the first step to better understanding something is to try and explain it to someone else. 

I currently work with Airbus in Toulouse, France, where I get to learn from some incredible people, while helping to shape the future of the Aerospace industry.

Before then, I worked for QANTAS Airways in Australia, with a focus on AI & Emerging Technologies.

You can read more about what I do where Airbus [here](https://www.airbus.com/careers/working-for-airbus/faces-of-airbus/meet-cameron.html).
